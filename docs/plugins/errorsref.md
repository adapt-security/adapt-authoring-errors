# Errors Reference

This page documents all errors which are likely to be thrown in the system, along with the appropriate HTTP status code and any supplemental data which is stored with the error. 

Supplemental data can be used at the point that errors are translated to provide more context to a specific error. All data stored with an error can be assumed to be a primitive type for easy printing.
